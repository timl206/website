        "I positioned my capital against the establishment since 2015. First started with Bitcoin, and then in 2016 with Ethereum. I then shifted some crypto gains to gold & silver in December 2017. Since then I've been holding these long term positions, only adding more throughout the years until there's enough blood on the streets."
