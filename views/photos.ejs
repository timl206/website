  <h3 class="text"> Bitcoin v. Banks of Suriname </h3>
  <p class="text"> "Until 1957, De Surinaamsche Bank acted as the default issuer of currency. The Central Bank of Suriname is currently Suriname's highest monetary authority and the country's governing body in monetary and economic affairs. The problem with central banks issuing currency is that they have the power to create as much as they want, hence flooding the market, which affects the purchasing power. Bitcoin fixes this by being the first decentralized peer-to-peer network with no central authority and a limited supply. It is borderless, and you have total control and authority over your Bitcoin. Transactions cannot be frozen or intercepted, it cannot be censored, and it cannot be stopped. By opting out of the central bank system, it means removing the power that politically-driven entities have on your life's savings." </p>

Although I was afraid of going out, I promised myself to get out of bed early in the morning just to stroll around the spot where folks usually bring out their birds on the Sundays. Today was as quiet as it could be. I felt awkward, not because of the situation, but because it's been a while since I've been strolling and taking photos of the streets in Paramaribo." </p>
