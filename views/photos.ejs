  <h3 class="text"> Sunday morning at the Independence Square of Suriname </h3>
  <p class="text"> "It's the 3rd day since Suriname announced its first case of COVID-19, a pandemic of the 21st century. Although I was afraid of going out, I promised myself to get out of bed early in the morning just to stroll around the spot where folks usually bring out their birds on the Sundays. Today was as quiet as it could be. I felt awkward, not because of the situation, but because it's been a while since I've been strolling and taking photos of the streets in Paramaribo." </p>
