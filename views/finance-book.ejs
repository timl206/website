    In the Book of Finance is where I keep my personal Financial Journal and of my Investment Fund.
    <br/><br/>
    I started managing my personal financial journal since 2014, learned to make financial statements in 2016 and since then turned my financial performance into graphs.
    <br/><br/>
    At the end of 2019, I started a test fund called TL Investment Fund to develop some skills in practice.
    <br/><br/>
    Below are links to my personal Financial Journal and the Investment Fund.
